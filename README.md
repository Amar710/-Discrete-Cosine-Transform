Project Title: 2D Discrete Cosine Transform Calculator with Java Swing GUI

Overview:
This project introduces a 2D Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) calculator, featuring a Java Swing GUI for user interaction. The application prompts users to input an integer 'N' (ranging from 2 to 16) and an NxN matrix. It then performs the 2D DCT transformation and displays the results in two modes: (1) by processing rows first and then columns, and (2) by processing columns first and then rows.

Usage:

Launching the Application:

Run the Java application to launch the user-friendly GUI.
Input a .txt file with the desired integer 'N' and populate the NxN matrix elements.
Performing 2D DCT Transformation:

Click on the appropriate buttons to execute the 2D DCT transformation.
Two options are provided: rows first and then columns, or columns first and then rows.
Viewing Results:

Observe the input matrix and the resulting transformed matrices displayed in the GUI.
The transformed matrices are rounded to integers for readability.
Implementation:

Java Swing GUI:

The GUI includes input fields for 'N' and matrix elements.
Buttons trigger the 2D DCT transformation for both row-first and column-first approaches.
Text areas dynamically display the input matrix and the resulting transformed matrices.
Input Validation:

Validates the user's input for 'N' and ensures it falls within the specified range (2 to 16).
Verifies the input matrix size to be NxN.
2D DCT Transformation:

Implements the 2D DCT algorithm for efficient matrix transformations.
Provides options for processing rows first and then columns, or columns first and then rows.
Conclusion:
This project delivers a versatile 2D DCT calculator with a Java Swing GUI, enhancing user experience through an intuitive interface. Users can explore the impact of different transformation approaches on their input matrices. Future updates may include additional features, optimizations, or support for alternative DCT variants based on user feedback.
